# tagless-talk

This is the material used for my PHASE talk on tagless final.  I added a few comments to the files that I didn't present.

<b>src/Talk.scala</b> - File created during the first part of the talk, goes over constructing the tagless final pattern.</br>
<b>src/Talk2.scala</b> - File created during the second part of the talk, applies tagless final as an alternative to the free monad.

<b>src/Addl/Help.scala</b> - Contains the boolean expression language from the middle of the talk.

<b>src/done/Done.scala</b> - First part of the talk, finished beforehand.</br>
<b>src/done/Done2.scala</b> - Second part of the talk, finished beforehand.</br>
<b>src/done/Done3.scala</b> - Implemented an example of using an interpreter to convert the structure of a tagless final program.</br>
<b>src/done/Done4.scala</b> - A different solution for structural conversion that leaves the interpretation more flexible. (see comments)</br>
